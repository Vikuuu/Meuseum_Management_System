Sure, here's a concise description of the project:

Project Description:
The "Global Museums" project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to explore museums around the world based on their interests. The application interacts with a MySQL database for user authentication, museum details, and transactions.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: The application allows users to log in with their username and password. An admin login is also available.

2. User Signup: New users can create an account by providing their personal details like first name, last name, phone number, email, gender, and date of birth.

3. Main Interface: After successful login or signup, users are presented with their primary interests, such as science and technology, sports, art, or toys.

4. Museum Selection: Based on the user's chosen interest, a list of museums with their details, such as museum code, name, address, country, charges, days open, and timings, is displayed.

5. Booking: Users can book a visit to a specific museum by selecting the museum from the list and providing the number of visitors.

6. Bill Generation: After the booking is confirmed, a bill is generated, showing visitor details, museum name, number of visitors, total charges, GST amount, and the net payable amount.

7. Admin Panel: Admins can log in separately and access additional features such as viewing the list of all museums, adding new museums, and deleting existing museums.

8. MySQL Database: All user details, museum information, and transaction records are stored and managed using a MySQL database.

Overall, "Global Museums" simplifies the process of exploring and booking museum visits worldwide, enhancing the user experience through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
